Project Title: Analyzing Ride-Sharing Data with SQL

Description:
This project provides SQL queries for analyzing ride-sharing data extracted from Ola, a popular ride-sharing service. The dataset contains information about ride bookings including pickup/drop locations, driver details, booking types, fares, and more.
